Features:

- Cancel button for cancelling download process (`--gradio-queue` required)
- Debug snapshot.<br/>
When `global_debug = True`, the moment this extension launch, it saves the current state of the webui on various location (into `snapshot.txt`), and when you type `#debugresetdownloads` on the textbox, it will compare the current state and the last saved state, and removes every new file/folder. This will be useful for debugging and testing.
